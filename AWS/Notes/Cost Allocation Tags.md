A tag is a label that you or AWS assigns to an AWS resource. Each tag consists of a key and a value. For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value. You can use tags to organize your resources and cost allocation tags to track your AWS costs on a detailed level.

After you or AWS applies tags to your AWS resources (such as Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon S3 buckets) and you activate the tags in the Billing and Cost Management console, AWS generates a cost allocation report as a comma-separated value (CSV file) with your usage and costs grouped by your active tags. You can apply tags that represent business categories (such as cost centers, application names, or owners) to organize your costs across multiple services.
