### Point-in-time recovery (PITR)
**Point-in-time recovery (PITR)**Â is a useful feature that can protect your DynamoDB tables from accidental write or delete operations. With this feature, you can eliminate the need for manual backups, scheduling, and maintenance.

PITR allows you to create continuous backups of your table and restore it to any specific point in time within a retention period of up to 35 days. In the scenario, you can use PITR to achieve the recovery point objective of one hour by restoring the table to a state just before any corruption occurs.
