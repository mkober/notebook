Migrating and integrating files into an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system while keeping the current file permissions intact can be easily achieved using a combination of AWS services. First, the AWS Snowcone device can collect the files from the current storage system, even in remote locations where traditional computing resources are unavailable. With its robust and versatile capabilities, the Snowcone device can store up to 8 TB of data and run applications, making it an excellent option for collecting files.

Next, AWS DataSync agents can be installed on the source and target storage systems. These agents facilitate data transfer between them, ensuring a highly reliable and secure transfer with support for various data transfer protocols, including NFS, SMB, and S3. DataSync tasks can be scheduled to run automatically or initiated manually, providing flexibility and control over the transfer process.

Finally, the files can be integrated into an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system, which provides high performance, high availability, automatic backups, and easy restoration capabilities for Windows-based applications. The fully managed file storage service is optimized for Windows workloads and supports the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, ensuring a fully compatible file system. With this combination of AWS services, organizations can easily migrate and integrate their files into a secure, reliable, and scalable file storage solution without compromising current file permissions.

The DataSync agent is pre-installed on your Snowcone device as an AMI during the Snowcone job preparation. To transfer data online to AWS, connect the Snowcone device to the external network and use AWS OpsHub or the CLI to launch the DataSync agent AMI. Activate the DataSync agent in the AWS Management Console or use the CLI, and set up your online data transfer task between the Snowcone NFS store, and Amazon S3, Amazon EFS, or Amazon FSx for Windows File Server.
