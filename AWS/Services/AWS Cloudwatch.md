**Amazon CloudWatch** is a monitoring service for AWS cloud resources and the applications you run on AWS. You can use Amazon CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, collect and monitor log files, and set alarms. Amazon CloudWatch can monitor AWS resources such as Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon DynamoDB tables, and Amazon RDS DB instances, as well as custom metrics generated by your applications and services and any log files your applications generate. You can use Amazon CloudWatch to gain system-wide visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and operational health.

The main requirement in the scenario is to monitor the `SwapUtilization` metric. Take note that you can’t use the default metrics of CloudWatch to monitor the `SwapUtilization` metric. To monitor custom metrics, you must install the CloudWatch agent on the EC2 instance. After installing the CloudWatch agent, you can now collect system metrics and log files of an EC2 instance.
