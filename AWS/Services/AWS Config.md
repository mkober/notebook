**AWS Config**Â is a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. Config continuously monitors and records your AWS resource configurations and allows you to automate the evaluation of recorded configurations against desired configurations. With Config, you can review changes in configurations and relationships between AWS resources, dive into detailed resource configuration histories, and determine your overall compliance against the configurations specified in your internal guidelines. This enables you to simplify compliance auditing, security analysis, change management, and operational troubleshooting.

You can use AWS Config to evaluate the configuration settings of your AWS resources. By creating an AWS Config rule, you can enforce your ideal configuration in your AWS account. It also checks if the applied configuration in your resources violates any of the conditions in your rules. The AWS Config dashboard shows the compliance status of your rules and resources. You can verify if your resources comply with your desired configurations and learn which specific resources are noncompliant.
