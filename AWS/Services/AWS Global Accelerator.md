**AWS Global Accelerator**Â is a service that improves the availability and performance of your applications with local or global users. It provides static IP addresses that act as a fixed entry point to your application endpoints in a single or multiple AWS Regions, such as your Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, or Amazon EC2 instances.

When the application usage grows, the number of IP addresses and endpoints that you need to manage also increase. AWS Global Accelerator allows you to scale your network up or down. AWS Global Accelerator lets you associate regional resources, such as load balancers and EC2 instances, to two static IP addresses. You only whitelist these addresses once in your client applications, firewalls, and DNS records.

With AWS Global Accelerator, you can add or remove endpoints in the AWS Regions, run blue/green deployment, and A/B test without needing to update the IP addresses in your client applications. This is particularly useful for IoT, retail, media, automotive, and healthcare use cases in which client applications cannot be updated frequently.

If you have multiple resources in multiple regions, you can use AWS Global Accelerator to reduce the number of IP addresses. By creating an endpoint group, you can add all of your EC2 instances from a single region in that group. You can add additional endpoint groups for instances in other regions. After it, you can then associate the appropriate ALB endpoints to each of your endpoint groups. The created accelerator would have two static IP addresses that you can use to create a security rule in your firewall device. Instead of regularly adding the Amazon EC2 IP addresses in your firewall, you can use the static IP addresses of AWS Global Accelerator to automate the process and eliminate this repetitive task.
