**AWS Lambda** supports the synchronous and asynchronous invocation of a Lambda function. You can control the invocation type only when you invoke a Lambda function. When you use an AWS service as a trigger, the invocation type is predetermined for each service. You have no control over the invocation type that these event sources use when they invoke your Lambda function. Since processing only takes 5 minutes, Lambda is also a cost-effective choice.

You can use an AWS Lambda function to process messages in an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Lambda event source mappings support standard queues and first-in, first-out (FIFO) queues. With Amazon SQS, you can offload tasks from one component of your application by sending them to a queue and processing them asynchronously.

Kinesis Data Streams is a real-time data streaming service that requires the provisioning of shards. Amazon SQS is a cheaper option because you only pay for what you use. Since there is no requirement for real-time processing in the scenario given, replacing Kinesis Data Streams with Amazon SQS would save more costs.
