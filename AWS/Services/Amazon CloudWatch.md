**Amazon CloudWatch**Â has available Amazon EC2 Metrics for you to use for monitoring CPU utilization, Network utilization, Disk performance, and Disk Reads/Writes. In case you need to monitor the below items, you need to prepare a custom metric using a Perl or other shell script, as there are no ready to use metrics for:

1. Memory utilization
2. Disk swap utilization
3. Disk space utilization
4. Page file utilization
5. Log collection

Take note that there is a multi-platform CloudWatch agent which can be installed on both Linux and Windows-based instances. You can use a single agent to collect both system metrics and log files from Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises servers. This agent supports both Windows Server and Linux and enables you to select the metrics to be collected, including sub-resource metrics such as per-CPU core. It is recommended that you use the new agent instead of the older monitoring scripts to collect metrics and logs.
