**Amazon Comprehend** uses machine learning to help you uncover the insights and relationships in your unstructured data. The service identifies the language of the text; extracts key phrases, places, people, brands, or events; understands how positive or negative the text is; analyzes text using tokenization and parts of speech, and automatically organizes a collection of text files by topic. You can also use AutoML capabilities in Amazon Comprehend to build a custom set of entities or text classification models that are tailored uniquely to your organization’s needs.

In this scenario, you can build the application with the help of Amazon Comprehend. You could expose the application through a RESTful endpoint, have it invoke a Lambda function that will call Amazon Comprehend for sentiment analysis, and index data into an Amazon OpenSearch cluster.
