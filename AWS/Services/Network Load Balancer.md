A **Network Load Balancer** functions at the fourth layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. It can handle millions of requests per second. After the load balancer receives a connection request, it selects a target from the default rule’s target group. It attempts to open a TCP connection to the selected target on the port specified in the listener configuration.

Based on the given scenario, web service clients can only access trusted IP addresses. To resolve this requirement, you can use the Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP) feature to use the trusted IPs as Elastic IP addresses (EIP) to a Network Load Balancer (NLB). This way, there’s no need to re-establish the whitelists with new IP addresses.
