The Sustainability pillar includes the long-term environmental, economic, and societal impact of your business activities. the united nations world commission on environment and development defines sustainable development as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs." your business or organization can have negative environmental impacts like direct or indirect carbon emissions, unrecyclable waste, and damage to shared resources like clean water.

When building cloud [workloads](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value."), the practice of sustainability is understanding the impacts of the services used, quantifying impacts through the entire [workload](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value.") lifecycle, and applying design principles and [best practices](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.best-practice.en.html "Proven ways of achieving successful outcomes.") to reduce these impacts. The sustainability pillar focuses on environmental impacts, especially energy consumption and efficiency, since they are important levers for architects to inform direct action to reduce resource usage.

## Design Principles

There are six design principles for sustainability in the cloud:

- **Understand your impact**: Measure the impact of your cloud [workload](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value.") and model the future impact of your [workload](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value."). Include all sources of impact, including impacts resulting from customer use of your products, and impacts resulting from their eventual decommissioning and retirement. Compare the productive output with the total impact of your cloud [workloads](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value.") by reviewing the resources and emissions required per unit of work. Use this data to establish key [performance](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.pillar.performance.en.html "The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.") indicators (KPIs), evaluate ways to improve productivity while reducing impact, and estimate the impact of proposed changes over time.
    
- **Establish sustainability goals**: For each cloud [workload](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value."), establish long-term sustainability goals such as reducing the compute and storage resources required per transaction. Model the return on investment of sustainability improvements for existing [workloads](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value."), and give owners the resources they need to invest in sustainability goals. Plan for growth, and architect your [workloads](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value.") so that growth results in reduced impact intensity measured against an appropriate unit, such as per user or per transaction. Goals help you support the wider sustainability goals of your business or organization, identify regressions, and prioritize areas of potential improvement.
    
- **Maximize utilization**: Right-size [workloads](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value.") and implement efficient design to ensure high utilization and maximize the energy efficiency of the underlying hardware. Two hosts running at 30% utilization are less efficient than one host running at 60% due to baseline power consumption per host. At the same time, shut down or minimize idle resources, processing, and storage to reduce the total energy required to power your [workload](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value.").
    
- **Anticipate and adopt new, more efficient hardware and software offerings**: Support the upstream improvements your partners and suppliers make to help you reduce the impact of your cloud [workloads](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value."). Continually monitor and evaluate new, more efficient hardware and software offerings. Design for flexibility to allow for the rapid adoption of new efficient technologies.
    
- **Use managed services**: Sharing services across a broad customer base helps maximize resource utilization, which reduces the amount of infrastructure needed to support cloud [workloads](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value."). For example, customers can share the impact of common data center [components](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.component.en.html "The code, configuration and AWS Resources that deliver against a business requirement.") like power and networking by migrating [workloads](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value.") to the AWS Cloud and adopting managed services, such as AWS Fargate for serverless containers, where AWS operates at scale and is responsible for their efficient operation. Use managed services that can help minimize your impact, such as automatically moving infrequently accessed data to cold storage with Amazon S3 Lifecycle configurations or Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to adjust capacity to meet demand.
    
- **Reduce the downstream impact of your cloud workloads**: Reduce the amount of energy or resources required to use your services. Reduce or remove the need for customers to upgrade their devices to use your services. Test using device farms to understand expected impact and test with customers to understand the actual impact from using your services.
    

## Definition

There are six best practice areas for sustainability in the cloud:

- [Region selection](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.pillar.sustainability.en.html#sus.area_region)
- [Alignment to demand](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.pillar.sustainability.en.html#sus.area_user_patterns)
- [Software and architecture](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.pillar.sustainability.en.html#sus.area_software)
- [Data](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.pillar.sustainability.en.html#sus.area_data)
- [Hardware and services](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.pillar.sustainability.en.html#sus.area_hardware)
- [Process and culture](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.pillar.sustainability.en.html#sus.area_dev_deployment)

Your [architecture](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.architecture.en.html "How components interact and communicate.") affects the sustainability of your [workload](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value."). Optimize [workload](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value.") placement, and optimize your [architecture](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.architecture.en.html "How components interact and communicate.") for user, software, data, hardware, and development and deployment patterns to increase energy efficiency. Each of these areas represents opportunities to employ [best practices](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.best-practice.en.html "Proven ways of achieving successful outcomes.") to reduce the sustainability impact of your cloud [workload](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value.") by maximizing utilization, and minimizing waste and the total resources deployed and powered to support your [workload](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value.").

The architectural improvement process includes understanding what you have and what you can do to improve, selecting targets for improvement, testing improvements, adopting successful improvements, quantifying your success and sharing what you have learned so that it can be replicated elsewhere, and then repeating the cycle.

The goals of your improvements can be:

In early stages of optimization, first focus on areas with waste or low utilization, and then move toward more targeted optimizations that fit your specific [workload](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value.").

Monitor changes to the consumption of resources over time. Identify where accumulated changes result in inefficient or significant increases in resource consumption. Determine the need for improvements to address the changes in consumption and implement the improvements you prioritize.

## Best Practices

### Region selection

The choice of Region for your [workload](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value.") significantly affects its KPIs, including [performance](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.pillar.performance.en.html "The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve."), [cost](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.pillar.costOptimization.en.html "The ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point."), and carbon footprint. To effectively improve these KPIs, you should choose Regions for your [workloads](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value.") based on both business requirements and [sustainability](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.pillar.sustainability.en.html "The long-term environmental, economic, and societal impact of your business activities. The United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development defines sustainable development as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs." Your business or organization can have negative environmental impacts like direct or indirect carbon emissions, unrecyclable waste, and damage to shared resources like clean water.") goals.

AWS provides a more extensive global footprint than any other cloud provider, and to support its global footprint and ensure customers are served across the world, AWS opens new Regions rapidly. AWS maintains multiple geographic Regions, including Regions in North America, South America, Europe, China, Asia Pacific, South Africa, and the Middle East.

The following questions focus on these considerations for sustainability.

|   |
|---|
|[**SUS 1:** How do you select Regions for your workload?](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.question.SUS_1.en.html)|

Choose Regions near Amazon renewable energy projects and Regions where the grid has a published carbon intensity that is lower than other locations (or Regions).

### Alignment to demand

The way users and applications consume your [workloads](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value.") and other resources can help you identify improvements to meet [sustainability](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.pillar.sustainability.en.html "The long-term environmental, economic, and societal impact of your business activities. The United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development defines sustainable development as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs." Your business or organization can have negative environmental impacts like direct or indirect carbon emissions, unrecyclable waste, and damage to shared resources like clean water.") goals. Scale infrastructure to continually match demand and verify that you use only the minimum resources required to support your users. Align service levels to customer needs. Position resources to limit the network required for users and applications to consume them. Remove unused assets. Provide your team members with devices that support their needs and minimize their [sustainability](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.pillar.sustainability.en.html "The long-term environmental, economic, and societal impact of your business activities. The United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development defines sustainable development as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs." Your business or organization can have negative environmental impacts like direct or indirect carbon emissions, unrecyclable waste, and damage to shared resources like clean water.") impact.

With AWS can use managed monitoring tools to analyze user patterns, manage the automatic scaling of deployed resources and take advantage of the AWS global infrastructure to optimize the geographic placement of [workloads](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value.").

The following questions focus on these considerations for sustainability.

|   |
|---|
|[**SUS 2:** How do you align cloud resources to your demand?](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.question.SUS_2.en.html)|

Define and update service level agreements (SLAs) such as [availability](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.availability.en.html "A measurement of a system's ability to provide its designed functionality.") or data retention periods to minimize the number of resources required to support your [workload](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value.") while continuing to meet business requirements.

Analyze application assets (such as pre-compiled reports, datasets, and static images) and asset access patterns to identify redundancy, underutilization, and potential decommission targets. Consolidate generated assets with redundant content (for example, monthly reports with overlapping or common datasets and outputs) to remove the resources consumed when duplicating outputs. Decommission unused assets (for example, images of products that are no longer sold) to free consumed resources and reduce the number of resources used to support the [workload](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value.").

Analyze network access patterns to identify where your customers are connecting from geographically. Select Regions and services that reduce the distance that network traffic must travel to decrease the total network resources required to support your [workload](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value.").

Optimize resources provided to team members to minimize the [sustainability](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.pillar.sustainability.en.html "The long-term environmental, economic, and societal impact of your business activities. The United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development defines sustainable development as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs." Your business or organization can have negative environmental impacts like direct or indirect carbon emissions, unrecyclable waste, and damage to shared resources like clean water.") impact while supporting their needs. For example, perform complex [operations](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.pillar.operationalExcellence.en.html "The ability to support development and run workloads effectively, gain insight into their operations, and to continuously improve supporting processes and procedures to deliver business value."), such as rendering and compilation, on highly utilized shared cloud desktops instead of on under-utilized high-powered single user systems.

### Software and architecture

Implement patterns for performing load smoothing and maintaining consistent high utilization of deployed resources to minimize the resources consumed. [Components](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.component.en.html "The code, configuration and AWS Resources that deliver against a business requirement.") might become idle from lack of use because of changes in user behavior over time. Revise patterns and [architecture](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.architecture.en.html "How components interact and communicate.") to consolidate under-utilized [components](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.component.en.html "The code, configuration and AWS Resources that deliver against a business requirement.") to increase overall utilization. Retire [components](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.component.en.html "The code, configuration and AWS Resources that deliver against a business requirement.") that are no longer required. Understand the [performance](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.pillar.performance.en.html "The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.") of your [workload](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value.") [components](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.component.en.html "The code, configuration and AWS Resources that deliver against a business requirement."), and optimize the [components](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.component.en.html "The code, configuration and AWS Resources that deliver against a business requirement.") that consume the most resources. Be aware of the devices your customers use to access your services, and implement patterns to minimize the need for device upgrades.

With AWS, [workload](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value.") developers have their choice of languages and technologies to use, allowing them to select the most appropriate technology for a given [problem](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.problem.en.html "An event that requires intervention and either recurs or cannot currently be resolved.").

The following questions focus on these considerations for sustainability.

|   |
|---|
|[**SUS 3:** How do you take advantage of software and architecture patterns to support your sustainability goals?](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.question.SUS_3.en.html)|

Monitor [workload](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value.") activity to identify changes in utilization of individual [components](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.component.en.html "The code, configuration and AWS Resources that deliver against a business requirement.") over time. Remove [components](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.component.en.html "The code, configuration and AWS Resources that deliver against a business requirement.") that are unused and no longer required, and refactor [components](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.component.en.html "The code, configuration and AWS Resources that deliver against a business requirement.") with little utilization, to limit wasted resources.

Monitor [workload](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value.") activity to identify application [components](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.component.en.html "The code, configuration and AWS Resources that deliver against a business requirement.") that consume the most resources. Optimize the code that runs within these [components](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.component.en.html "The code, configuration and AWS Resources that deliver against a business requirement.") to minimize resource usage while maximizing [performance](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.pillar.performance.en.html "The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.").

Understand the devices and equipment your customers use to consume your services, their expected lifecycle, and the financial and [sustainability](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.pillar.sustainability.en.html "The long-term environmental, economic, and societal impact of your business activities. The United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development defines sustainable development as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs." Your business or organization can have negative environmental impacts like direct or indirect carbon emissions, unrecyclable waste, and damage to shared resources like clean water.") impact of replacing those [components](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.component.en.html "The code, configuration and AWS Resources that deliver against a business requirement."). Implement software patterns and [architectures](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.architecture.en.html "How components interact and communicate.") to minimize the need for customers to replace devices and upgrade equipment. For example, implement new features using code that is backward compatible with older hardware and operating system versions, or manage the size of payloads so they don’t exceed the storage capacity of the target device.

Understand how data is used within your [workload](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value."), consumed by your users, transferred, and stored. Select technologies to minimize data processing and storage requirements.

### Data

Implement data management practices to reduce the provisioned storage required to support your [workload](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value."), and the resources required to use it. Understand your data, and use storage technologies and configurations that best support the business value of the data and how it’s used. Lifecycle data to more efficient, less performant storage when requirements decrease, and delete data that’s no longer required.

With AWS you can tag and manage the lifecycle of data assets, enabling you to automate the selection of the most appropriate storage class for your [workload](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value.").

The following questions focus on these considerations for sustainability.

|   |
|---|
|[**SUS 4:** How do you take advantage of data management policies and patterns to support your sustainability goals?](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.question.SUS_4.en.html)|

Use storage that best supports how your data is accessed and stored to minimize the resources provisioned while supporting your [workload](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value."). For example, solid state devices (SSDs) are more energy intensive than magnetic drives and should be used only for active data use cases. Use energy-efficient, archival-class storage for infrequently accessed data.

Manage the lifecycle of all your data and automatically enforce deletion timelines to minimize the total storage requirements of your [workload](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value.").

To minimize total provisioned storage, create block storage with size allocations that are appropriate for the [workload](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value."). Use elastic volumes to expand storage as data grows without having to resize storage attached to compute resources. Regularly review elastic volumes and shrink over-provisioned volumes to fit the current data size.

Duplicate data only when necessary to minimize total storage consumed. Use backup technologies that deduplicate data at the file and block level. Limit the use of Redundant Array of Independent Drives (RAID) configurations except where required to meet SLAs.

Adopt shared storage and single sources of truth to avoid data duplication and reduce the total storage requirements of your [workload](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value."). Fetch data from shared storage only as needed. Detach unused volumes to free resources. Minimize data movement across networks: Use shared storage and access data from regional data stores to minimize the total networking resources required to support data movement for your [workload](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value.").

To minimize storage consumption, only back up data that has business value or is required to satisfy compliance requirements. Examine backup policies and exclude ephemeral storage that doesn’t provide value in a recovery scenario.

### Hardware and services

Look for opportunities to reduce [workload](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value.") [sustainability](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.pillar.sustainability.en.html "The long-term environmental, economic, and societal impact of your business activities. The United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development defines sustainable development as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs." Your business or organization can have negative environmental impacts like direct or indirect carbon emissions, unrecyclable waste, and damage to shared resources like clean water.") impacts by making changes to your hardware management practices. Minimize the amount of hardware needed to provision and deploy, and select the most efficient hardware and services for your individual [workload](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value.").

With AWS you have the choice of the latest processor, storage, networking, and operating system, to help you best match the needs of your [workload](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value.") and tools to automate scaling and monitoring of the resources deployed.

The following questions focus on these considerations for sustainability.

|   |
|---|
|[**SUS 5:** How do you select and use cloud hardware and services in your architecture to support your sustainability goals?](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.question.SUS_5.en.html)|

Using the capabilities of the cloud, you can make frequent changes to your [workload](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value.") implementations. Update deployed [components](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.component.en.html "The code, configuration and AWS Resources that deliver against a business requirement.") as your needs change.

Continually monitor the release of new instance types and take advantage of energy efficiency improvements, including those instance types designed to support specific [workloads](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value.") such as machine learning training and inference, and video transcoding.

Managed services shift responsibility for maintaining high average utilization, and [sustainability](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.pillar.sustainability.en.html "The long-term environmental, economic, and societal impact of your business activities. The United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development defines sustainable development as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs." Your business or organization can have negative environmental impacts like direct or indirect carbon emissions, unrecyclable waste, and damage to shared resources like clean water.") optimization of the deployed hardware, to AWS. Use managed services to distribute the [sustainability](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.pillar.sustainability.en.html "The long-term environmental, economic, and societal impact of your business activities. The United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development defines sustainable development as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs." Your business or organization can have negative environmental impacts like direct or indirect carbon emissions, unrecyclable waste, and damage to shared resources like clean water.") impact of the service across all tenants of the service, reducing your individual contribution.

Graphics processing units (GPUs) can be a source of high-power consumption, and many GPU [workloads](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value.") are highly variable, such as rendering, transcoding, and machine learning training and modeling. Only run GPUs instances for the time needed, and decommission them with automation when not required to minimize resources consumed.

### Process and culture

Look for opportunities to reduce your [sustainability](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.pillar.sustainability.en.html "The long-term environmental, economic, and societal impact of your business activities. The United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development defines sustainable development as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs." Your business or organization can have negative environmental impacts like direct or indirect carbon emissions, unrecyclable waste, and damage to shared resources like clean water.") impact by making changes to your development, test, and deployment practices.

With AWS, you can use automation and [AWS developer tools](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.devtools.en.html "A set of services designed to enable rapid and safe delivery of software") to accelerate [sustainability](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.pillar.sustainability.en.html "The long-term environmental, economic, and societal impact of your business activities.

|[**SUS 6:** How do your organizational processes support your sustainability goals?](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.question.SUS_6.en.html)|

Test and validate potential improvements before deploying them to production. Account for the [cost](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.pillar.costOptimization.en.html "The ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.") of testing when calculating potential future benefit of an improvement. Develop low-[cost](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.pillar.costOptimization.en.html "The ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.") testing methods to enable delivery of small improvements.

Up-to-date operating systems, libraries, and applications can improve [workload](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value.") efficiency and enable easier adoption of more efficient technologies. Up-to-date software might also include features to measure the [sustainability](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.pillar.sustainability.en.html "The long-term environmental, economic, and societal impact of your business activities. The United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development defines sustainable development as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."

Your business or organization can have negative environmental impacts like direct or indirect carbon emissions, unrecyclable waste, and damage to shared resources like clean water.") goals.

Use automation and infrastructure as code to bring pre-production environments up when needed and take them down when not used. A common pattern is to schedule periods of [availability](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.availability.en.html "A measurement of a system's ability to provide its designed functionality.") that coincide with the working hours of your development team members. Hibernation is a useful tool to preserve state and rapidly bring instances online only when needed. Use instance types with burst capacity, Spot Instances, elastic database services, containers, and other technologies to align development and test capacity with use.

Managed device farms spread the [sustainability](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.pillar.sustainability.en.html "The long-term environmental, economic, and societal impact of your business activities.
