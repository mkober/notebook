Learn to use environment variables in AWS CDK stacks to store sensitive data and user-specific settings and make them easily consumable inside any stack!

Environment variables are a vital part of any project, they allow us to easily store confidential information like API keys and secrets and user-specific configuration settings such as deployment regions and contact information, etc. So, when it comes to working with AWS CDK stacks, itâ€™s important we use environment variables to ensure we donâ€™t share this sensitive information as well as make it easier for others to set up and deploy the stack should we share it with them.

In this post, weâ€™re going to look at how to configure environment variables to work with AWS CDK stacks and make them easy to consume and use anywhere in the stack with the help of a single configuration file.

The first thing we need to do in our CDK stack is create a new file (`` `.env` ``) in the root of our repository to contain our environment variables. Inside this file, weâ€™re going to create two new environment variables.

```
1REGION = "eu-west-2";2LAMBDA_ENV = "test";
```

The first one we will use to control the AWS region we want to deploy to and the second one will be a variable weâ€™ll pass through to a lambda function to demonstrate passing an environment variable through to a service configured in our CDK stack.

After this, weâ€™re then going to add thisÂ `` `.env` ``Â file to ourÂ `` `.gitignore` ``Â file to make sure we donâ€™t commit our environment variables by accident. Once ourÂ `` `.env` ``Â file is ignored in git, weâ€™re going to install theÂ `` `dotenv` ``Â package usingÂ `` `npm i dotenv` ``, this will allow us to read in our environment variables and use them in the project.

With that all sorted, letâ€™s create the file that is going to let us access our environment variables from anywhere in the stack. To do this, create a new file in theÂ `` `lib` ``Â directory calledÂ `` `config.ts` ``Â and add the below code.

./lib/config.ts

```
1import * as dotenv from "dotenv";2import path = require("path");3
4// 1. Configure dotenv to read from our `.env` file5dotenv.config({ path: path.resolve(__dirname, "../.env") });6
7// 2. Define a TS Type to type the returned envs from our function below.8export type ConfigProps = {9  REGION: string;10  LAMBDA_ENV: string;11};12
13// 3. Define a function to retrieve our env variables14export const getConfig = (): ConfigProps => ({15  REGION: process.env.REGION || "us-east-1",16  LAMBDA_ENV: process.env.LAMBDA_ENV || "",17});
```

ts

This file is pretty simple, weâ€™re first importingÂ `` `dotenv` ``Â and configuring it to read in our environment variables from theÂ `` `.env` ``Â file we created. Weâ€™re then defining a TypeScript type that matches the environment variables we return from aÂ `` `getConfig()` ``Â function.

ThisÂ `` `getConfig()` ``Â function is where everything happens, we can call this function and get access to the values of ourÂ `` `.env` ``Â file and if for some reason theyâ€™re undefined, weâ€™re able to define a fallback value as we have done with theÂ `` `REGION` ``Â variable to fallback toÂ `` `us-east-1` ``.

With our stack setup complete, letâ€™s look at how we can consume our environment variables using theÂ `` `getConfig()` ``Â function we just defined. First, letâ€™s edit our stack entry file in ourÂ `` `bin` ``Â directory to control the region weâ€™re going to deploy to as well as pass our config through to any stacks defined in the file. To do this, weâ€™re going to use the code below.

./bin/*-stack.ts

```
1#!/usr/bin/env node2import "source-map-support/register";3import * as cdk from "aws-cdk-lib";4import { AwsEnvStack } from "../lib/aws-env-stack";5import { getConfig } from "../lib/config";6
7// 1. Retrieving our config and envs8const config = getConfig();9
10const app = new cdk.App();11
12new AwsEnvStack(app, "AwsEnvStack", {13  env: {14    // 2. Passing our REGION env to our stack to control the region it's deployed to15    region: config.REGION,16  },17  // 3. Passing our entire config to our stack as a prop for us to use.18  config,19});
```

ts

In this file, we retrieve our configuration using theÂ `` `getConfig()` ``Â function. Then we use ourÂ `` `REGION` ``Â environment variable to define the region weâ€™d like the stack to be deployed to. We also then pass our entire config as a prop to our stack so we can retrieve all of our environment variables from props instead of calling theÂ `` `getConfig()` ``Â function again.

At this point, if youâ€™re using TS you might get an error regarding theÂ `` `config` ``Â being passed as a prop and it not being assignable to the type ofÂ `` `StackProps` ``Â so letâ€™s sort that out in our stack definition file in ourÂ `` `lib` ``Â directory.

To fix the above-mentioned error we need to define a new type and use that to type the props being passed into the stack.

./lib/*-stack.ts

```
1import { Stack, StackProps } from "aws-cdk-lib";2import { Construct } from "constructs";3import { NodejsFunction } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda-nodejs";4import { ConfigProps } from "./config";5
6// 1. New type for the props adding in our configuration7type AwsEnvStackProps = StackProps & {8  config: Readonly<ConfigProps>;9};10
11export class AwsEnvStack extends Stack {12  // 2. Consuming our type for `props` and making props mandatory13  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: AwsEnvStackProps) {14    super(scope, id, props);15
16    // 3. Retrieving our config with our environment variables from the props17    const { config } = props;18  }19}
```

ts

So, with the above code, we define a new type that extendsÂ `` `StackProps` ``Â to also include ourÂ `` `config` ``Â object with the type we created earlier as the return type of theÂ `` `getConfig()` ``Â function. We then use this new type to type the props being passed into the stack before pulling ourÂ `` `config` ``Â object out of the props.

At this point, we can now use our environment variables from ourÂ `` `config` ``Â object inside our CDK stack as well as with the services defined inside our stack. To demonstrate this letâ€™s create an example lambda function to log out our environment variable from earlier. To do this create a new file atÂ `` `./resources/test-lambda.ts` ``Â and add in the below code.

./resources/test-lambda.ts

```
1export const handler = () => {2  console.log(process.env.LAMBDA_ENV);3};
```

ts

Letâ€™s now define our new lambda function inside our CDK stack definition file in ourÂ `` `lib` ``Â directory by adding the below code under where we destructured ourÂ `` `config` ``Â object earlier.

./lib/*-stack.ts

```
1// ...rest of the stack definition2const { config } = props;3
4// Lambda definition5new NodejsFunction(this, "TestLambda", {6  entry: "./resources/test-lambda.ts",7  handler: "handler",8  environment: {9    LAMBDA_ENV: config.LAMBDA_ENV,10  },11});
```

ts

The important part to note in this definition is the environment object where you can see weâ€™re passing in theÂ `` `LAMBDA_ENV` ``Â from ourÂ `` `config` ``Â object. This is then consumed in the lambda function usingÂ `` `process.env.LAMBDA_ENV` ``Â which is then logged out. And, with this lambda function defined and configured, weâ€™ve finished writing our CDK stack so letâ€™s move on to deploying and testing it!

To deploy our CDK stack runÂ `` `cdk deploy` ``Â in your terminal and accept any prompts given to you by the console.

**NOTE:**Â You may need to install theÂ `` `esbuild` ``Â package withÂ `` `npm i esbuild` ``Â as weâ€™re using theÂ `` `NodejsFunction` ``Â construct which requires this package to deploy.

Once your stack has finished deploying you can check if the region environment variable worked as planned by reviewing the deployment logs in your terminal. Towards the top of the logs, you should see mentioned the region youâ€™re deploying to, this should align with theÂ `` `REGION` ``Â environment variable you configured earlier.

To test if theÂ `` `LAMBDA_ENV` ``Â environment variable and all of the setup we did worked as planned, we can invoke the lambda by using the CLI with the command below (make sure to switch outÂ `` `LAMBDA_NAME` ``Â with the name of your deployed lambda which you can get from your AWS dashboard or CLI).

```
1aws lambda invoke --function-name  LAMBDA_NAME   --invocation-type Event -
```

Once your lambda has been invoked, check the log outputs for it in CloudWatch by using the AWS dashboard and you should see the value of theÂ `` `LAMBDA_ENV` ``Â from earlier logged out. If this is the case, congrats, everything is working as planned and you have environment variables configured in your AWS CDK stack!

During this post, weâ€™ve looked at why environment variables are important to a project as well as how you can use them inside an AWS CDK stack by using a single configuration file and passing the config to our stacks as props.
