# ACID 
ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. It is a set of transactional properties that ensure the reliability of #database transactions.

**Atomicity** means that a transaction is either all committed or all rolled back. This prevents partial updates from being committed to the database, which could lead to data inconsistencies.

**Consistency** means that a transaction maintains the integrity of the database. This means that the database is always in a valid state, even after a transaction has been committed.

**Isolation** means that one transaction cannot see the changes made by another transaction until the second transaction has committed. This prevents concurrent transactions from interfering with each other.

**Durability** means that once a transaction has been committed, the changes made by the transaction cannot be lost. This is even true if there is a power failure or other system failure.

ACID transactions are essential for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of database data. They are used in a variety of database applications, including banking systems, inventory management systems, and online transaction processing (OLTP) systems.

Here is an example of how ACID transactions work:

1. A customer wants to transfer $100 from their savings account to their checking account.
2. The bank's database system begins a transaction.
3. The database system withdraws $100 from the customer's savings account.
4. The database system deposits $100 into the customer's checking account.
5. The database system commits the transaction.
